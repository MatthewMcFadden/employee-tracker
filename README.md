# Employee Tracker
Employee Tracker is an employee management system where users can view and manage the departments, roles, and employees in the company by name, id, title, and salary. Through the command line, users are presented with the following options: view employees by departments, view all roles, view all employees, add an employee, and update an employee role. When a user chooses to view a department, role, or all employees the application will display a formatted table showing all employees and needed information like job title, role id number, department, salary, etc.
